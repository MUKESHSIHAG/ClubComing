## Guidelines For Contribution

Hope you've got a gist of the project after reading the README.md
Once you've understood the idea, start reading the issues and try solving them.

If you have any questions regarding anything in this repository, please don't hesitate in asking on our local gitter channel:

https://gitter.im/ClubComing/clubcoming

It's a community lobby where other people who have contributed to this idea will also be able to guide you.

## Beginner Tips
- Clone the program and follow the 'How to Run' steps in the README file.
- You do **NOT** need to study the entire code to start contributing.

## Issue Making

- Any form of bug, code error, feature enhancements, UI Changes request, or any other form of issue can be put up by anyone. 
- Once you make an issue, please wait for the Project Owner's 'go-ahead' remark to start working on that idea if you 
yourself want to resolve your issue. 
- Follow this Template:

```
**Issue-Type**: Bug/Code Error/Feature Enhancements/UI Changes
**Issue**: /* Your Issue Here */
**Assign To**: Me/Anyone
```

## Issue Resolving

- If you want to resolve an issue that is currently not assigned to anyone, please ask for permission to do that. 
This is because more than one person can submit the code for the same issue, and we certainly don't want anyone's hard work to go unrecognized.
- No specific template is needed for this. Just simply say that you can do this, and want to. :)

## Making Pull Requests

- After you fork the project,and push your changes to your forked repository, you will see an option to make a pull request above your file list.
- Click on that, and in the next page, you will have an option to comment something before making the PR.
- In the comments section, write the following for your PR
  1. Reference the Issue Number for which you're making the Pull Request in your comments.
  2. Mention your changes in a concise way if possible. 
    - If the change is in the UI Design, try uploading a screenshot of the changed UI page
    - If the change is for resolving a bug/optimisation, point out your optimisation for it.
    - If the change is for feature enhancements, just point out the files changed.
